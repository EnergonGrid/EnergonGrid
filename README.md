ENERGON is live on Flare Mainnet.

A state-based protocol: discrete progression, deterministic guardrails, and fully observable transitions.

There are no incentives to optimize.  
There are no strategies to execute.  
There is only state.

Progression is height-based, on-chain, and cannot be accelerated, skipped, or automated.  
All transitions are observable.  
No off-chain schedulers.  
No privileged operators.

One wallet. One cube. One guardian.

This is not a recommendation or preference.  
It is an enforced condition.

0 cubes → no participation  
1 cube  → coherent state  
2+ cubes → fractured state  

The protocol does not interpret intent.  
It reads state.

Observation precedes action.

Minimal surface. Observable state. ENERGON
